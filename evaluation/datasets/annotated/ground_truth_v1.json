Experiment 2 is obtained from an experiment in which earthworms (Eisenia fetida) exposed to control and 4n-4 nanomaterial treated soil, respectively. Worms were exposed to either of the treatments for 2, 3, 4 or 7 days, after which they were harvested. 4 jars were used per treatment and exposure time, which resulted in a total of 32 jars. Every jar contained 4 worms of which one was selected for RNA-seq. Furthermore, 4 worms were frozen at the start of the experiment, which served as the references.
