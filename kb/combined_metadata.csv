Study,default,Study title,mandatory,"{text}{10,}",Cultivation and characterization of anaerobic Dehalobacter-enriched microbial cultures that dechlorinate monochlorobenzene to benzene ,,http://schema.org/title,Title describing the study
Study,default,Study description,mandatory,"{text}{50,}","Monochlorobenzene (MCB) is a soil and groundwater pollutant. At contaminated sites, MCB can originate from the reductive dechlorination of other chlorinated pollutants such as hexachlorocyclohexane. MCB detoxification at field sites may be feasible using existing bioaugmentation technologies as long as suitable enrichment cultures are developed. Mixed microbial cultures that dechlorinate MCB were obtained from an enrichment culture that dechlorinates 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TCB) to a mixture of dichlorobenzene, MCB, and benzene. In these cultures, Dehalobacter populations are responsible for the observed dechlorination. Under current cultivation conditions, rates of MCB dechlorination in MCB-fed cultures are smaller compared to 1,2,4-TCB-fed cultures. In MCB-fed cultures, MCB dechlorination stalls after several dechlorination cycles. In mixed microbial cultures, challenges with MCB dechlorination may also be related to electron donor limitation, micronutrient deficiency, and interspecies metabolic dependencies. In this project, we will use the parallel bioreactor platform to characterize a mixed microbial MCB-dechlorinating culture. We hypothesize that culture cultivation in well-controlled continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) with biomass retention will be beneficial for MCB dechlorination. Experiments will be designed in order to identify dechlorination rate-limiting processes and to identify suitable parameters for continuous cultivation. In these systems, we hope to achieve sustained dechlorination activity and higher biomass accumulation. ",,http://schema.org/description,Description of the study
