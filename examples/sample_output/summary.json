    "abstract": "Soil microorganisms play crucial roles in nutrient cycling, plant health, and ecosystem functioning. This study presents a comprehensive metagenomic analysis of soil microbial communities from agricultural fields under different fertilization regimes. We collected soil samples from 15 agricultural sites across three different fertilization treatments: organic compost, synthetic fertilizer, and control (no fertilization). DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit, followed by sh",
